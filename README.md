# RP1-Deploying-a-GKE-cluster-in-GCP-using-Terraform

The purpose of this project to simplify infrastructure deployment in GCP using Terraform.
You will find in this repo the necessary to perform the following:
  - Deploy a single GKE cluster with 2 node pools with [Terraform](https://terraform.io)
  - Deploy and expose a containerized app using [gcloud cli](http://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs#install_the_latest_cloud_tools_version_cloudsdk_current_version) and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/%C2%A0%C2%A0) 

But before, you need to set up a [GCP account](https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started) and create a project.

## Steps

1- Enable the Kubernetes Engine API as shown below.

2- The code is available and working well but I'm still working on it. I'll complete this Readme as soon as possible üòÅ. 

Just check for updates....
